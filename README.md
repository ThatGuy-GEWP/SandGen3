## What is this?
### This is:
  A falling sand game engine, that allows for easy implmentation of custom element logic and reactions,
  one of the main goals of this project was for high performance with low complexity.
  Mostly this is for internal use, however you can mess around with it if you like!

### This ISNT:
A massive scale sand engine, although performance is not too bad on large worlds, the point of
this engine is for a modular base to build games ontop of (as it already has a custom ECS built with sfml packaged with it)

As the name says, this is not the first, or last Sandgen.

Sandgen is a project a couple of years in the making, i have made many mistakes and will make many more!

## Is it functional?
Yes!

### You can make your own elements!

### Add your own reactions!

### And add custom logic!

I mostly only push changes when they are done, or before i tear them down and make new ones. so at all times you *should* be able to
compile and run the master branch.

## How do i do the whole compile/running part?
There is probably a better way, but just opening with Visual Studio works for me

## Any roadmap?
No, my inspiration is sparse, and promising things kills it most the time.
And if the project goes silent, i am most likely updating stuff in the background.
Not pushing changes until a major rework/update is a bad habit of mine.

## What engine are you using?
A custom game engine that uses SFML.Net bindings for all the gritty stuff of rendering and audio,
its an entity component system, functions closely to a lighter version of unity,
If your missing any functionality, making your own components is very easy, and *most* of the existing components have documentation

(Made right **before** unity decided to send its engine down the drain, for an unrelated project)
