# SandGen (Again)


### What is this?
As the name says, this is not the [first sandgen](https://github.com/timmyred456/Sandgen-Sharp)

Sandgen is a project a couple of years in the making, i have made many mistakes and will make many more!
the plan currently is for this to be the base of a flexible game engine,
that i can use to make an idea i have had on the backburner for years now.

### Is it functional?
Yes! as of writing im just getting started, but you can mess around, and script your own elements in relatively few steps
I mostly only push changes when they are done, or before i tear them down and make new ones. so at all times you *should* be able to
compile and run the master branch.

### How do i do the whole compile/running part?
There is probably a better way, but just opening with Visual Studio works for me

### Wait did you say custom game engine?
Yes, my little engine uses SFML.Net bindings for all the gritty stuff of rendering and audio,
If your missing any functionality, making your own components is very easy, and *most* of the existing components have documentation
its an entity component system, functions closely to a lighter version of unity

(Made right **before** unity decided to send its engine down the drain, for an unrelated project)

### Any roadmap?
No, my inspiration is sparse, and promising things kills it most the time.
And if the project goes silent, i am most likely updating stuff in the background, 
not pushing changes until a major rework/update is a bad habit of mine.
