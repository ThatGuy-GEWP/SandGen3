# SandGen (Again)


### What is this?
As the name says, this is not the first, or last sandgen.

Sandgen is a project a couple of years in the making, i have made many mistakes and will make many more!
the plan currently for this is to be the base of a flexible game engine
that i can use to make an idea i have had on the backburner for years now.

### Is it functional?
Yes!

You can even make your own elements!

And add custom logic!

I mostly only push changes when they are done, or before i tear them down and make new ones. so at all times you *should* be able to
compile and run the master branch.

### How do i do the whole compile/running part?
There is probably a better way, but just opening with Visual Studio works for me

### Any roadmap?
No, my inspiration is sparse, and promising things kills it most the time.
And if the project goes silent, i am most likely updating stuff in the background.
Not pushing changes until a major rework/update is a bad habit of mine.

### What engine are you using?
A custom game engine that uses SFML.Net bindings for all the gritty stuff of rendering and audio,
its an entity component system, functions closely to a lighter version of unity,
If your missing any functionality, making your own components is very easy, and *most* of the existing components have documentation

(Made right **before** unity decided to send its engine down the drain, for an unrelated project)
